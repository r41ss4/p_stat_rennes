# Business Perspective on Fraud Detection   
**Objective:** The primary goal is to predict fraudulent transactions using the dataset and the Random Forest model. This helps businesses identify and prevent fraudulent activities, thereby reducing financial losses and enhancing security.    

## Predicting Fraudulent Transactions   
**1. Data Analysis**    
    *   Descriptive Statistics: Understand the basic characteristics of the data, such as mean, median, and standard deviation of transaction amounts.      
    *   Probability Distributions: Analyze the distribution of transaction amounts to identify any anomalies or patterns.   

**2. Feature Engineering**      
    *   Creating Fraud Criteria: If you decide to create your own fraud criteria, you can define rules based on transaction amount, high-risk merchants, and other relevant features.   
    *   Handling Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables (e.g., merchant type, card type) into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding.            

**3. Modeling**     
    *   Random Forest: Train a Random Forest model to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. This model uses multiple decision trees to make predictions, which improves accuracy and robustness.           
    *   Bootstrap: Use bootstrap sampling to estimate the accuracy of the model and ensure it generalizes well to new data.         

## Statistica techniques
**1. Data Understanding and Preparation**               
    *   Load and explore the dataset.         
    *   Handle missing values and data types.   

**2. Introduction to Statistics**           
    *   Perform descriptive statistics.           
    *   Analyze probability distributions, including the binomial distribution.     

**3. Sampling Distributions**           
    *   Estimate confidence intervals.                    
    *   Perform data analysis using R.            

**4. Modeling Relationships**               
    *   Conduct correlation analysis.         
    *   Implement simple and multiple regression models.   

**5. Advanced Techniques**          
    *   Apply bootstrap methods.          
    *   Use random forest for fraud detection.
